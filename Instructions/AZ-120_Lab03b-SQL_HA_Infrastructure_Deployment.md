# Exercise 1: Provision Azure resources necessary to support highly available SAP NetWeaver deployments

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will deploy Azure infrastructure compute components necessary to configure Windows clustering. This will involve creating a pair of Azure VMs running Windows Server 2016 in the same availability set.

## Task 1: Deploy a pair of Azure VMs running highly available Active Directory domain controllers by using an Azure Resource Manager template

1.  Type **Deploy a custom template (1)** in the search box of the Azure portal menu, and select it **(2)**.

     ![](../images/3.md/deploytemplate.png)

1.  From the **Custom deployment** blade, scroll down to **Quickstart template (disclaimer) (1)** and select the **application-workloads/active-directory/active-directory-new-domain-ha-2-dc-zones (2)**, from the drop-down list then click **Select template (3)**.

    ![](../images/3.md/selectemplate.png)
    

    > **Note**: Alternatively, you can launch the deployment by navigating to Azure Quickstart Templates page at <https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates>, locating the template named **Create 2 new Windows VMs, a new AD Forest, Domain and 2 DCs in separate availability zones**, and initiating its deployment by clicking **Deploy to Azure** button.

1.  On the blade **Create a new AD Domain with 2 DCs using Availability Zones**, specify the following settings :

    -   Subscription: Select your **Azure subscription (1)**

    -   Resource group: Choose the resource group **az12003b-ad-RG (2)** form the drop-down list

    -   DnsPrefix: Enter **dns<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/> (8)**

    -   Vm Size: **Standard D2s_v3 (9)**

    -   _artifacts Location: Enter **https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/application-workloads/active-directory/active-directory-new-domain-ha-2-dc-zones/** **(10)**

    -   _artifacts Location Sas Token: Leave it as default **(11)**
    
    - Click on **Review + Create (12)**.
    
     ![](../images/3.md/customdeployment.png)

1. Review the configuration and click on **Create**
    > **Note**: The deployment should take about 35 minutes. Wait for the deployment to complete before you proceed to the next task.

    > **Note**: If the deployment fails with the **Conflict** error message during deployment of the CustomScriptExtension component, use the following steps  to remediate this issue:

    - in the Azure portal, on the **Deployment** blade, review the deployment details and identify the VM(s) where the installation of the CustomScriptExtension failed

    - in the Azure portal, navigate to the blade of the VM(s) you identified in the previous step, select **Extensions**, and from the **Extensions** blade, remove the CustomScript extension

    - in the Azure portal, navigate to the **az12003b-sap-RG** resource group blade, select **Deployments**, select the link to the failed deployment, and select **Redeploy**, select the target resource group (**az12003b-sap-RG**) and provide the password for the root account (**Pa55w.rd1234**).

1. After the deployment completes, in the Azure portal, navigate to the resource group **az12003b-ad-RG** and from **Overview (1)** page click on **adPDC (2)** virtual machine.

    ![](../images/3.md/adpcvm.png)
    
1. From in the vertical navigation menu, select **Run command (1)** under **Operations** and click on **RunPowerShell Script (2)**.

    ```
    New-ItemProperty 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip6\Parameters\' -Name 'DisabledComponents' -Value 0xffffffff -PropertyType 'DWord'
    Restart-Computer -Force
    ```

   ![](../images/3.md/runscript.png)
   
   > **Note :** Wait until the **adPDC** virtual machine is running again
   
1. Navigate to the blade of the **adBDC** virtual machine, select **Run command** from **Operations** section and click on **RunPowerShell Script**.

    ![](../images/3.md/runcommand1.png)

1. On the **Run Command Script** pane, in the **PowerShell Script** text box, enter the following script and select the **Run** button:

    ```
    New-ItemProperty 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip6\Parameters\' -Name 'DisabledComponents' -Value 0xffffffff -PropertyType 'DWord'
    Restart-Computer -Force
    ```
    ![](../images/3.md/runscript.png)
    
    > **Note :** Wait until the **adBDC** virtual machine is running again
    
1. Navigate to the blade of the **adPDC** virtual machine, in the vertical navigation menu, in the **Operations** section, select **Run command**, on the **Run Command Script** pane, in the **PowerShell Script** text box, enter the following script and select the **Run** button:

    ![](../images/3.md/addsubnet2.png)

1.  In the Azure Portal, start a PowerShell session in Cloud Shell. 

    > **Note**: If this is the first time you are launching Cloud Shell in the current Azure subscription, you will be asked to create an Azure file share to persist Cloud Shell files. If so, accept the defaults, which will result in creation of a storage account in an automatically generated resource group.

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to set the value of the variable `$resourceGroupName` to the name of the resource group containing the resources you provisioned in the previous task:

    ```
    $resourceGroupName = 'az12003b-ad-RG'
    ```

1.  In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to identify the virtual network created in the previous task:

    ```
    $vNetName = 'adVNet'

    $subnetName = 'sapSubnet'
    ```

1.  In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to identify the Resource Id of the newly created subnet:

    ```
    $vNet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -Name $vNetName
    
    (Get-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name $subnetName -VirtualNetwork $vNet).Id
    ```

1.  Copy the resulting value to Clipboard. You will need it in the next task.

        $registryEntry = 'DisableCARetryOnInitialConnect'
        $registryValue = 1
        New-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $registryEntry -Value $registryValue -PropertyType DWORD -Force
    }

    Invoke-Command $nodes {
        $registryPath = 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA'
