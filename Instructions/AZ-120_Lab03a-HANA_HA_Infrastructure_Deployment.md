# Exercise 1: Provision Azure resources necessary to support highly available SAP NetWeaver deployments

In this exercise, you will deploy Azure infrastructure compute components necessary to configure Linux clustering. This will involve creating a pair of Azure VMs running Linux SUSE in the same availability set.

#### Task 1: Create a virtual network that will host a highly available SAP NetWeaver deployment

1.  In the Azure Portal, start a Bash session in Cloud Shell. 

     ![](../images/az120-4ab-1.png)

1.  When *no storage mounted* is prompted, then select Show advanced settings and then select Use existing and choose **az12003a-dmz-RG** resource group. Then select Create new against Storage account and enter **cloudstore <inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** and for File Share, select Create new and enter **blob** and then click on Create storage, and wait for the Azure Cloud Shell to initialize.

     ![](../images/az120-4ab-3.png)
     
     ![](../images/az120-4ab-4.png)     


1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to set the value of the variable `RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME` to the name of the resource group which was precreated and will use this resource group to provision new resources. 

    ```cli
    RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME='az12003a-sap-RG'
    ```

1.  In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to create a virtual network with a single subnet in the existing resource group:

    ```cli
    VNET_NAME='az12003a-sap-vnet'

    VNET_PREFIX='10.3.0.0/16'

    SUBNET_NAME='sapSubnet'

    SUBNET_PREFIX='10.3.0.0/24'

    az network vnet create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $VNET_NAME --address-prefixes $VNET_PREFIX --subnet-name $SUBNET_NAME --subnet-prefixes $SUBNET_PREFIX
    ```

1.  In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to identify the Resource Id of the subnet of the newly created virtual network:

    ```cli
    az network vnet subnet list --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --vnet-name $VNET_NAME --query "[?name == '$SUBNET_NAME'].id" --output tsv
    ```

1.  Copy the resulting value to Clipboard. You will need it in the next task.

#### Task 2: Deploy Azure Resource Manager template provisioning Azure VMs running Linux SUSE that will host a highly available SAP NetWeaver deployment

1.  On the lab computer, start a browser and browse to [**https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/application-workloads/sap/sap-3-tier-marketplace-image-md**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/application-workloads/sap/sap-3-tier-marketplace-image-md)

    > **Note**: Make sure to use Microsoft Edge or a third party browser. Do not use Internet Explorer.

1.  On the page titled **SAP NetWeaver 3-tier (managed disk)**, click **Deploy to Azure**. This will automatically redirect your browser to the Azure portal and display the **SAP NetWeaver 3-tier (managed disk)** blade.

     ![](../images/az120-4ab-5.png)

1.  On the **SAP NetWeaver 3-tier (managed disk)** blade, select **Edit template**.

1.  On the **Edit template** blade, apply the following changes and select **Save**:

    -   in the line **197**, replace `"dbVMSize": "Standard_E8s_v3",` with `"dbVMSize": "Standard_D4s_v3",`

     ![](../images/labintro5.png)

1.  On the **SAP NetWeaver 3-tier (managed disk)** blade, initiate deployment with the following settings:

     ![](../images/az120-4ab-7.png)     

1.  Do not wait for the deployment to complete but instead proceed to the next task. 

     > **Note**: If the deployment fails with the **Conflict** error message during deployment of the CustomScriptExtension component, use the following steps  to remediate this issue:

     - in the Azure portal, on the **Deployment** blade, review the deployment details and identify the VM(s) where the installation of the CustomScriptExtension failed

     - in the Azure portal, navigate to the blade of the VM(s) you identified in the previous step, select **Extensions**, and from the **Extensions** blade, remove the CustomScript extension

     - in the Azure portal, navigate to the **az12003a-sap-RG** resource group blade, select **Deployments**, select the link to the failed deployment, and select **Redeploy**, select the target resource group (**az12003a-sap-RG**) and provide the password for the root account (**Pa55w.rd1234**).

#### Task 5: Grant permissions to Azure VMs to the service principal of the **STONITH app<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** 

1.  In the Azure portal, navigate to the blade of the **i20-db-0** Azure VM

1.  From the  **i20-db-0** blade, display the **i20-db-0 - Access control (IAM)** blade.

    ![](../images/az120-4ab-35.png)

1.  From the **i20-db-0 - Access control (IAM)** blade, add a role assignment with the following settings:

    -   Role: Search and select **Virtual Machine Contributor** and click on **Next**

    -   Assign access to: **user, group, or service principal** and click on **+select members** and search and select **Stonith app <inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** and click on **Add** and click on **Review + assign** twice to create the role assignment.

1.  Repeat the previous steps to assign the Stonith app the Virtual Machine Contributor role to the **i20-db-1** Azure VM

#### Task 6: Configure the STONITH cluster device 

1.  Within the RDP session to az12003a-vm0, switch to the PuTTY-based SSH session to i20-db-0.

1.  Within the RDP session to az12003a-vm0, in the PuTTY-based SSH session to i20-db-0, run the following commands (make sure to replace the `subscription_id`, `tenant_id`, `login_id,` and `password` placeholders with the values you identified in Exercise 3 Task 4:

    ```
    crm configure property stonith-enabled=true

    crm configure property concurrent-fencing=true

    crm configure primitive rsc_st_azure stonith:fence_azure_arm \
      params subscriptionId="subscription_id" resourceGroup="az12003a-sap-RG" tenantId="tenant_id" login="login_id" passwd="password" \
      pcmk_monitor_retries=4 pcmk_action_limit=3 power_timeout=240 pcmk_reboot_timeout=900 \
      op monitor interval=3600 timeout=120

    sudo crm configure property stonith-timeout=900
    ```

#### Task 7: Review clustering configuration on Azure VMs running Linux by using Hawk

1.  Within the RDP session to az12003a-vm0, start Internet Explorer and navigate to **https://i20-db-0:7630**. This should display the SUSE Hawk sign-in page.

   > **Note**: Ignore **This site is not secure** message.
   
   ![](../images/az120-4ab-38.png)

1.  On the SUSE Hawk sign in page, login by using the following credentials:

    -   Username: **hacluster**

    -   Password: **Pa55w.rd1234**

      ![](../images/az120-4ab-39.png)

1.  Verify that the cluster status is healthy. If you are seeing a message indicating that one of two cluster nodes is unclean, restart that node from the Azure portal.
